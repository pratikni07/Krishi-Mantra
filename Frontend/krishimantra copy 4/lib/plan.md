### Comprehensive Plan for Integrating Image Upload and Resolving Registration Process

1. **Update `auth_controller.dart`**:

   - Modify the `signupWithPhone` method to ensure it handles the image upload process correctly.
   - Ensure that the method calls the `_uploadImage` function to upload the image to the presigned URL before sending the signup request.

2. **Update `auth_repository.dart`**:

   - Ensure that the `signupWithPhone` method is correctly set up to handle the data being sent, including the image URL if provided.

3. **Update `presigned_url_repository.dart`**:

   - Ensure that the method for getting presigned URLs is functioning correctly and can handle requests for image uploads.

4. **Update `presigned_url_controller.dart`**:

   - Ensure that the `uploadImage` method is correctly implemented to upload images to the presigned URL and return the file URL.

5. **Update `signup_screen.dart`**:
   - Ensure that the UI allows users to select an image and that the selected image is passed to the `signupWithPhone` method in the `AuthController`.

### Follow-up Steps:

- Test the entire signup process to ensure that the image upload works seamlessly and that the registration process is completed successfully.
- Handle any errors that may arise during the image upload or registration process, providing appropriate feedback to the user.
